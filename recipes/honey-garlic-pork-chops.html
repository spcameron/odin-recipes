      When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will
      love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop
      recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular
      honey-garlic glaze â€” but the 30-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk
      too.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 2/3 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather
        ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a
        glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush
        glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer
        pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
