# odin-recipes

This is the first project in TOP. It focuses on implementing the HTML lessons from the Foundations
Course, and it consists of a main index page with a few links to recipe pages.

The earliest iteration of these pages focused strictly on HTML, with no styling.

The most recent version includes CSS and basic styling but stops short of flexbox.
